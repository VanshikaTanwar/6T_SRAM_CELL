### Abstract
This paper proposes the implementation of a 6T SRAM cell.A SRAM stores 1 bit of data and also explains its READ and WRITE operation and explains the function of how it stores 1 bit in a cell. This SRAM cell is designed with CMOS logic using the synopsys EDA tool.


### Synopsys Custom Compiler Tool Details
The Synopsys Custom Compilerâ„¢ design environment is a modern solution for full-custom analog, custom digital, and mixed-signal IC design. As the heart of the Synopsys Custom Design Platform, Custom Compiler provides design entry, simulation management and analysis, and custom layout editing features. It delivers industry-leading productivity, performance, and ease-of-use while remaining easy to adopt for users of legacy tools.
